# Online APK Building Guide

Since you don't have Android SDK installed locally, here are several ways to build your IPTV Player APK online:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub Account**: Go to github.com and create a free account
2. **Create Repository**: 
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it "IPTV-Player" 
   - Make it public
   - Initialize with README

3. **Upload Project Files**:
   - Click "Upload files" in your new repository
   - Upload ALL files from `C:\Users\Pro\IPTVPlayer\` folder
   - Commit the files

4. **Trigger Build**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Click "Build IPTV Player APK" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

5. **Download APK**:
   - Wait for build to complete (5-10 minutes)
   - Click on the completed build
   - Download "iptv-player-debug-apk" artifact
   - Extract the ZIP to get your APK file

### Advantages:
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Automatic builds
- ✅ No local setup required
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline

## Option 2: Gitpod (Browser-based IDE)

### Steps:
1. Push your project to GitHub (as above)
2. Go to gitpod.io and sign in with GitHub
3. Open your repository in Gitpod
4. Run: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
5. Download the APK from `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

### Advantages:
- ✅ Full development environment
- ✅ Browser-based
- ✅ No local installation

## Option 3: Repl.it/CodeSandbox

### Steps:
1. Go to replit.com or codesandbox.io
2. Create new Android project
3. Upload your source files
4. Use their terminal to run `./gradlew assembleDebug`

## Option 4: Online Build Services

### Android Build Services:
- **Appetize.io**: Upload source, get APK
- **BuddyBuild**: CI/CD for mobile apps
- **CircleCI**: Free tier for open source

## Option 5: Docker Online

### Using Play with Docker:
1. Go to labs.play-with-docker.com
2. Create session
3. Use Android build container:
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/project mingc/android-build-box bash -c "cd /project && ./gradlew assembleDebug"
```

## Quick Setup for GitHub Actions

If you choose GitHub Actions, here's the exact process:

### 1. Create .gitignore file:
Create `.gitignore` with this content:
```
*.iml
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea/
.DS_Store
/build
/captures
.externalNativeBuild
.cxx
local.properties
```

### 2. Upload to GitHub:
- Create new repository on GitHub
- Upload all project files
- Make sure `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` is included

### 3. Run the build:
- Go to Actions tab
- Click "Build IPTV Player APK"
- Click "Run workflow"
- Wait for completion
- Download APK from artifacts

## Alternative: Pre-built APK

If online building fails, you can also:

1. **Use Android Studio Online**: 
   - Some cloud providers offer Android Studio in browser
   - Google Cloud Shell has Android SDK

2. **Ask for Help**:
   - Post your project on developer forums
   - Someone can build it for you
   - Share GitHub repository link

3. **Use Cross-platform Tools**:
   - Xamarin.Forms
   - React Native
   - Flutter (though these require different code)

## Troubleshooting Online Builds

### Common Issues:
- **Build timeout**: Increase timeout in workflow
- **Missing dependencies**: Check gradle files
- **Permission errors**: Ensure gradlew has execute permissions

### GitHub Actions Fixes:
Add this to your workflow before build step:
```yaml
- name: Make gradlew executable
  run: chmod +x ./gradlew
```

## Final APK Installation

Once you have your APK:

1. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Android TV: Settings → Security → Unknown Sources → ON

2. **Transfer APK**:
   - USB drive
   - File sharing apps
   - Cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)

3. **Install**:
   - Use file manager app
   - Navigate to APK
   - Click install

4. **Launch**:
   - Find "IPTV Player" in your apps
   - Start using M3U playlists or Xtream Codes

**Note**: The GitHub Actions approach is recommended as it's free, reliable, and creates a proper build pipeline for your app.
